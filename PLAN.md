## View

- [ ] Document every exported function

- [ ] Many more components
- [ ] Form component with submit, validation etc

## Build

- [ ] Probably should name it better (`@torpor/launch`?)
- [x] Reuse layouts
- [x] Prefetch links
- [ ] Type-safety when calling endpoints
- [ ] Type-safety in forms
- [ ] Separate hooks into pre- and post-
  - [ ] Maybe do the same with middleware -- I don't love next() methods
