# torpor/build

A framework for building sites and apps with Torpor.

Built on top of [Vite](https://vite.dev).

ðŸš§ WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

## Installation

Use `npm` (or your preferred package manager) to create a starter project:

```bash
npm init @torpor/build@latest my-project
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Folder structure

- /src
  - /assets
  - /components
  - /lib
  - /routes
    - /api

## Maybe

Ideally, sites built with torpor/build will be easy to get set up and running, with flexible overrides for complex uses.

- middleware setup for auth etc
- file-based routing by default, with programmatic overrides
- type-safe routing and fetching
- type-safe websocket communication
- immediate or scheduled background tasks
- authentication and authorization
- localization and internationalization
- logs and (basic) analytics

## Routing
