# tera/kit

A framework for building libraries and/or sites with Tera.

Built with [Vinxi](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi).

🚧 WARNING: VERY INCOMPLETE 🚧

## Installation

Use `npm` (or your preferred package manager) to create a Vite project:

```bash
npm create vite
```

## Folder structure

- /lib
- /site
  - /api
  - /assets
  - /components
  - /routes

## Maybe

Ideally, sites built with tera/kit will be easy to get set up and running, with flexible overrides for complex uses.

- middleware setup for auth etc
- file-based routing by default, with programmatic overrides
- type-safe routing and fetching
- type-safe websocket communication
- immediate or scheduled background tasks
- authentication and authorization
- localization and internationalization
- logs and (basic) analytics
