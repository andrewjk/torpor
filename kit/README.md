# tera/kit

A framework for building libraries and/or sites with Tera.

Built with [Vinxi](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi).

## Installation

TODO:

## Folder structure

- /lib
- /site
  - /api
  - /assets
  - /components
  - /routes

## Maybe

Ideally, sites built with tera/kit will be easy to get set up and running, with flexible overrides for complex uses.

- middleware setup for routing, auth etc
- /router: type-safe routing with GETs, POSTs, ACTIONs
- /socket: type-safe websocket communication
- /tasks: immediate or scheduled background tasks
- /auth: authentication and authorization
- /region: localization and internationalization
- /logs: logs and (basic) analytics
